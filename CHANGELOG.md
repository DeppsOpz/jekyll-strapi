0.4.1-dev 

* Basic compatibility with Strapi 4 (Collections are working, Single Type not yet) Strapi incompatible with jekyll 4.0.0 #8
* Authentication (tested with Content API Token and Personal Token)
* Filter to fetch media object types from the Strapi 4 Instance
* Better error handling (distinguish 401 from 403, and handle 404 more accurate)
* Extra custom parameters - I believe it solves Sorting collection data #15
* Unttests with 'mock/fixtures'
